# Data_Science_Projects
This repo contains a list of code that I've done as a Data Scientist, not for commercial purposes outside GitHub.

Lost of project contained in here is the common 'binary-classification' problem, with some of them must be analyzed first before applied to machine learning model.

You will find the most of codings in the file named: "main_codes.ipynb" in every folder.
